    <h1>Fire and Ice</h1>
    <p>
        Some say the world will end in <b>fire</b>,<br/>
        Some say in <b>ice</b>.<br/>
        From what I've tasted of <b>desire</b><br/>
        I hold with those who favor <b>fire</b>.<br/>
        But if it had to perish <b>twice</b>,<br/>
        I think I know enough of <b>hate</b><br/>
        To know that for destruction <b>ice</b><br/>
        Is also <b>great</b><br/>
        And would <b>suffice</b>.
